    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
     <p>Cachupa is a famous dish from <strong>Cape Verde</strong>. It is a slow cooked stew of hominy (dried maize kernels that have been treated with an alkali), beans, cassava, sweet potato, fish or meat (sausage, beef, goat or chicken), and often morcela (blood sausage).
     <strong><em>Referred to as the country's national dish</em></strong>, each island has its own regional variation. The version of the recipe called cachupa rica tends to have more ingredients than the simpler cachupa pobre.
